## Where the tax data is pulled from?

The tax data is pulled from [http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/tax/worldwide-vat--gst-and-sales-tax-guide---rates](VAT, GST and sales tax rates â€” ey.com).

It is kept up-to-date with the year-by-year tax changes worldwide.

Some countries have multiple sales tax, eg. Brazil. In those cases, the returned sales tax is the one on services. Indeed, I consider most users of this module use it for their SaaS business â€” in other words, service businesses.
